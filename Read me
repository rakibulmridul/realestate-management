Currently,  a  number  of  property  portals  enjoy  popularity  in  Bangladesh.  They  act  like  free bulletin boards for property seekers. People browse and search for open available properties 
on  those  sites. They  also  can  view  user’s  profile  and  properties  pictures.  Seller  pay  those portals for posting their property for display to attract buyers. Those sites also allow buyer to 
seek  seller’s  profiles  as  per  their  requirement  in  return  for  a  payment  or  subscription.  So, essentially, the  seller pay for the service while the  buyer get  a free portal.  bikroy.com, falls 
into this category. These are typical classical buy sell portals. Some other portals allow property seller/  buyer post advertisement of their service  free.  In addition, the buyer get a free listing of the service providers. Such as, bikroy.com, clickbd.com, ekhanei.com  and  so  on  belong  to  this  category.  This value  chain  looks  simple: both  service 
seekers and providers get a portal of cross connection. These portals earn revenue/ value by display of sponsored advertisements under their listing of from banner advertisements on the 
portal itself. However, such portals seldom receive individual  seller posting their  properties for sell. This is a contrast between the classical portals and this type of portals.  Over all, the 
view point is a complete reversal of the first category. Here, to state in terms of portals, seller post their available properties. The buyer can browse and choose which property he should 
buy. However, their appearance look more like a common market place for any commodity or service than like a classical property / sell related portal. This is the second category.
